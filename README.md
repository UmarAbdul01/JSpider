# JSpider
JSpider is an advanced, multi-threaded Java library for crawling websites.
It can be used as a command line program with all it's primary features.
JSpider's start() function is non-blocking, which allow the invoking code to
access URLs live as they are captured (see the getOutputQueue() function).
